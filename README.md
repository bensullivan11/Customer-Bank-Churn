# Customer-Bank-Churn
This project provides a possible solution to help mitigate loses incurred by banks from annual customer churn.

## Data
The data set, provided by kaggle, contains 8 attributes on over 2000 bank customers along with the associated target vairable of whether the customer exited the bank or not.

## Modeling
7 different classification models were trained on the customer attributes and churn outcome with undersampling and oversampling techniques to enhance perfomance on the unbalanced data set.

Models were used then used to predict the occurance of a customer leaving the bank, and the recall score was used to measure performance. 

## Application
Using the customer churn probability predictions from the best model, potential increase in profits were examined when extending a targeted promotion to customers with the highest chance of exiting the bank.
